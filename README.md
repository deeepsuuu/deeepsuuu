### Hi, I'm Sudeep Mestry.

I am currently pursuing my M.Sc. in Physics with specialization in Astrophysics.

My main interest is using code to solve physics problems. I am currently learning Python, Machine Learning, and Data Analysis to apply them to computational physics and astrophysical data.

Current Focus: Physics, Astrophysics, Stellar physics with Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn and Pytorch.
