### Hi, I'm Sudeep Mestry.

I am a final-year M.Sc. Physics student specializing in Astrophysics.

My main interest is using code to solve physics problems. I am currently learning Python, Machine Learning, and Data Analysis to apply them to computational physics and astrophysical data.

Current Focus: Physics, Astrophysics, Stellar physics with Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn and Pytorch.
